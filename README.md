RaspberryPi-Node-PWMController
========================================

Control a PWM signal coming from the Raspberry Pi GPIO 17 and 18 using a Node.js, Express and Foundation web interface
At the minute the site doesn't use websockets and it probably should as that would allow the views to stay in sync across multiple devices.

But apart from that it is all working fine. I use Pi-Blaster.js as the PWM controller and it is super accurate.
